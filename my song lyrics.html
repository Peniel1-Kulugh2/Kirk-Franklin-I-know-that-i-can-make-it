        <h2>My Life Is In Your Hands</h2></b>
<p>No matter what your're going through</br>
    I know that you can stand</br>
    For your life is inâ€”in his hands</br>
    Listen</br>
</br>
    You don't have to worry</br>
    And don't you be afraid</br>
    Joy comes in the morning</br>
    Thank you, Jesus</br>
    Troubles they don't last always</br>
</br>
    For there's a friend named Jesus</br>
    Hallelujah</br>
    Who will wipe your tears away</br>
    And if your heart is broken</br>
    Just lift your hands and say</br>
    
    Oh, I know that I can make it</br>
    I know that I can stand</br>
    I know that I can stand</br>
    No matter what comes my way</br>
    No matter what may come my way</br>
    Jesus, my life</br>
    My life is in your hands</br>
    
    Let's sing it together</br>
    Listen</br>
</br>
    You don't have to worry</br>
    And don't you be afraid</br>
    And don't you be afraid</br>
    Joy cometh in the morning</br>
    Joy comes in the morning</br>
    Troubles. They don't last always</br>
    Troubles. They don't last always</br>
</br>
    For there's a friend named Jesus</br>
    For there's a friend named Jesus</br>
    Who will wipe every tear</br>
    Who will wipe your tears away</br>
    And if your heart is broken</br>
    And if your heart is broken</br>
    Just lift those hands and say</br>
    Just lift your hands and say</br>
</br>
    Come on, sing it with me</br>
    I know I can</br>
